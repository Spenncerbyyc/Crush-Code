                <p>
                I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with a diploma from Innotech College in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I also hold a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature from the University of Calgary.
                </p>
                <h4>Previous Experience</h4>
                <p>
                Life in B.C. (Before Coding) involved work in Concerts, as a Copywriter, Music Magazine Section Editor, Social Media Consultant and more. Even all of the above depending on the year. My previous skillset granted me experience working within hospitality, corporate, small-business, and not-for-profit environments.
                </p>
                <h4>Interests</h4>
                <p>My interests, like my career experiences, are varied. I posses an insatiable natural curiosity where I am always happy to try anything once. Reading, writing, music, and once I turned 18, craft beer became some of my favourite hobbies. Recently, I have added learning to code to my repository and thus, I now look forward to new languages the same way I eagerly anticipate a new journal, book, or evening pint.
                </p>
                <h4>Style and Goals</h4>
                <p>My coding and my writing share the same goal: to make the best impression while maintaining a simple, straightforward style. There is a time and place for utilizing the $5 words in your vocabulary, but communication between people is best when clear and concise. Whether that is copied, conversational, or coded. </p>
                <p>I am looking for an entry-level position with a forward-thinking organization. I am also open to freelance opportunities where available.
